# Synth-add-on-programmer

- Running out of room on your front panel? then add hidden functions with this handy programmer

I recently built a little non programmable mono synth into a 2U rack and ran out of space for functions I needed, so I added some manually on the rear panel like note priority etc. I then thought why not add a simple programmer to store certain functions in EEPROM on a Teensy or Arduino.

- 24 or more digital outputs 0-5V for switching options
- 2 DAC outputs 0-5V at 12 bits for controlling VCA's etc
- OLED menu selects the options and values and stores them in EEPROM.
- Push button menu selections and values.
- Teensy 2.0 based but could run on an Arduino Nano etc if there is enough memory.
