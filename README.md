# Synth-add-on-programmer

- Running out of room on your front panel? then add hidden functions with this handy programmer

I recently built a little non programmable mono synth into a 2U rack and ran out of space for functions I needed, so I added some manually on the rear panel like note priority etc. I then thought why not add a simple programmer to store certain functions in EEPROM on a Teensy or Arduino.
